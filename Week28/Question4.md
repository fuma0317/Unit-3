```
class week28():
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def getString(self,words):
        self.words = input("Please type any strings")

    def print(self,words):
        print("What you typed is: {}.".format(words))
 ```
 I got kind of confused to reuse the string I got in "getString" and term "upper case"
