## Client statement ##
Currently, my desk is messy because of a lot of books and I'm not really good at organizing my stuff. At the moment, there is no way to organize my books. Besides, I would like to categorize these books and have something like a database so that I can pick up a proper book whenever I want. In the database, I want you to record the title, the author, the genre, pages and until where I read. Lastly, I want the system to be only accessed by me!

## Developer statement ##
I am going to design a Music inventory software application for my client inclding a log-in system which only allows my client to enter. The software application helps my client to store the data such as genre, artist and date the song released. Additionally, the software application stores the information about my client's music based on the playlist of Sportify.
