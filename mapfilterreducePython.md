def area(r):
    """Area of a circle with radius 'r' ."""
    return math.pi * (r**2)

radii = [2, 5, 7.1, 0.3, 10]

map(area, radii)

list(map(area, radii))
```
I didn't figure out how to display the result like the on eon tthe video. 
What is the difference between "return" and "print"?
How does it replace radii with r?
