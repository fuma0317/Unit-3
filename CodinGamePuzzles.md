if dist_1 < dist_2: #if the distance 1 is smaller than distance 2
                    #which means enemy_1 is closer than enermy_2
    print(enemy_1)  #destory enemy_1
else:               
    print(enemy_2)  #destory enemy_2

## The Descent ## 
```
hile True:
    target = 0
    youheight = 9
    for i in range(8):
        youheight = youheight - 1
        target = 9 - youheight
    print(target)
 ```
 I couldn't come up with the solution of the problem.
