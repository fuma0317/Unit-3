# TELOS for Database Application Software #
## What TELOS Stands for? ##
```
1. T - Technical - Is the project  technically possible?
2. E - Economic - Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?
3. L - Legal - Is the project legal?
4. O - Operational - How will the current operations support the change?
5. S - Scheduling - Can the project be done in time?
```

## What my software does? ##
My software application sorts musics(in sportify) in 3 categories which is genre, artist and time produced. Besides, it shows the time added to the playlist for each musics. And it only allows one client to log in the database system.

## TELOS for my project ##
**Technical**
I'm sure that it is possible to make the system to store the database of each musics and the system to log in because we already learned how to create a login system in a class. And I think it would be easier to make database system with LIST.

**Economic**
It is totally fine. Python is provided for completely free.  

**Legal**
It is totally legal. In terms of copyright, the app just shows the basic information such as title and artist so it is fine.

**Operational**
I will use the basic functions which is predicted to be avaliable even though the version of Python is updated. And also, the app allows client to edit and delete the databse whenever they want.

**Scheduling**
I will make reminders what I have to do until the decided date on Google calender so that I'm able to keep track of time.
