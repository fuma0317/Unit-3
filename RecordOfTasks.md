# Record of Task #
This table reflects the five stages of design

| Task Number | Planned Action | Expected Outcome | Time Estimated | Target Completion | Criteria |
|-------------| ---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
|      1      | **Planning** Meet with client for a first conversation | ①Obtain the basic client requirements   | 30 min | The client's needs for the application was very clear and simple so I got to come up with some basic requirements | A |
|      2      | **Design** Draw some blief sketches for the User Interface of the application | ①Draw the blief sketch for User Interface that meets client's needs that I obtained in the last meeting ②Show the sketch to the client and find out any improvements | 30 min + 10 min | I got inspired by a certain music app and sketch the UI by including some jokes. And my client was satisfied with the design and system. | A |
|      3      | **Development** Create log-in system for the application | ①Create the system that encrypts the password which is typed by users ②create the system that shows the data or jump to other page if the user type correct password | 60 min | During the class, I was kind of confused by the encrypting system that originally exists in Python. I need to practice more | B |
|      4      | **Design** Create GUI for the application with QT designer | ①Learn how to use QT designer ②Make creative and user friendly GUI based on the client's needs | 240 min | I spend too much time on this because I'm not really used to QT designer.
