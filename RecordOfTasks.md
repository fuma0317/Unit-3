# Record of Task #
This table reflects the five stages of design

| Task Number | Planned Action | Expected Outcome | Time Estimated | Target Completion | Criteria |
|-------------| ---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------------|----------|
|      1      | **Planning** Meet with client for a first conversation | ①Obtain the basic client requirements   | 30 min | The client's needs for the application was very clear and simple so I got to come up with some basic requirements | A |
|      2      | **Design** Draw some blief sketches for the User Interface of the application | ①Draw the blief sketch for User Interface that meets client's needs that I obtained in the last meeting ②Show the sketch to the client and find out any improvements | 30 min + 10 min | I got inspired by a certain music app and sketch the UI by including some jokes. And my client was satisfied with the design and system. | A |
|      3      | **Development** Create log-in system for the application | ①Create the system that encrypts the password which is typed by users ②create the system that shows the data or jump to other page if the user type correct password | 60 min | During the class, I was kind of confused by the encrypting system that originally exists in Python. I need to practice more | B |
|      4      | **Design** Create GUI for the application with QT designer | ①Learn how to use QT designer ②Make creative and user friendly GUI based on the client's needs | 240 min | I spend too much time on this because I'm not really used to QT designer. However, I'm really satisfied with the design of GUI | A |

# Development #
## Making secure log-in system ##
*What is hash ?*
```
hash is a fingerprint of some digital data. If you covert exact same word, hash is also exact same. It is NOT random.
All hash have same length.
```
*What is byte and bit?*
```
bit is a unit measuring the size of data. 8bits = 1 byte 
```
*what is ascii*
```
a code that is comprised of [0, 1] which is converted from other digits or strings.
It is an initial code and that can represent 256 characters.
```
*what is unicode and UTF-8*
```
These are basically same as ascii but they were invented for the sake of more complicated language.
UTF-8 is compatible with ascii as it shows the ascii part with 1 byte and other parts with 2 - 6 bytes.
```
