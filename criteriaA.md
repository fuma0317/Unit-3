# CRITERIA A for the software application #

## Definition of Problem ##
This is the g-mail I got from my client. Based on this, I designed my application making making sure that it meets client's needs
```
I have a lot of music but no interesting way to quickly sort them or find specific songs. 
It would be  very nice if I could sort my songs into categories or based on information about them. 
I would like an app that would sort and categorize my music for more pleasant listening
```

## Proposed Solutuion ##
I need a database software application that sorts books into 5 categories which are title, the author, genre, pages and until where I read so that I can pick up a proper book whenever I want. Lastly, I want the system to be only accessed by me.

## Success Criteria for the software system ##
1. It shows title, autor, genre, pages, until where I read for each books.
1. It is able to be edit and delete by user
1. It only allows the user to login (exclusive)
1. Manual is added to the software
1. Easy to use(it should be easy for begginers)
