# CRITERIA A for the software application #

## Definition of Problem ##
At the moment, I have a lot of books on my desk, but it is unorganized and my desk is so messy. Besides, I usually forget until where I already read.

## Proposed Solutuion ##
I need a database software application that sorts books into 5 categories which are title, the author, genre, pages and until where I read so that I can pick up a proper book whenever I want. Lastly, I want the system to be only accessed by me.

## Success Criteria for the software system ##
1. It shows title, autor, genre, pages, until where I read for each books.
1. It is able to be edit and delete by user
1. It only allows the user to login (exclusive)
1. Manual is added to the software
1. Easy to use(it should be easy for begginers)
