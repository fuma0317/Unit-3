# CRITERIA A for the software application #

## Definition of Problem ##
This is the g-mail I got from my client. Based on this, I designed my application making making sure that it meets client's needs
```
I have a lot of music but no interesting way to quickly sort them or find specific songs. 
It would be  very nice if I could sort my songs into categories or based on information about them. 
I would like an app that would sort and categorize my music for more pleasant listening
```

## Proposed Solutuion ##
Create a software application which sorts musics into 7 categories which is "Rock", "EDM", "Reggae", "Game", "Hiphop", "J-pop" and "K-pop". And also the application shows the songs' title, artsit, length of time and when the song was added to playlist in Spotify. This database will be only used by my client(Shin)

## Success Criteria for the software system ##
1. Secure login system that only allows the client to login
1. It is able to be edit and delete by user
1. Songs are sorted in 7 categories 
1. It shows the title, artist, length of time and the date that songs were added
1. Manual is added to the software
1. Easy to use(it should be easy for begginers)
