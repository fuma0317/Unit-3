# CRITERIA A for the software application #

## Definition of Problem ##
I have a lot of music but no interesting way to quickly sort them or find specific songs. It would be  very nice if I could sort my songs into categories or based on information about them. I would like an app that would sort and categorize my music for more pleasant listening

## Proposed Solutuion ##
I will make a software application that sorts musics in 3 categories which is genre, artist and time produced as database. And also it shows the time added to the playlist for each musics. Additionally, the musics are gathered from spotify.   

## Success Criteria for the software system ##
1. It allows only the client to log in
1. It organizes musics in genre, artist, time produced
1. It makes 3 files and each database should be recorded in them
1. It shows the time added to the playlist for each musics
1. Database of musics can be editted and deleted by user 
1. It collects musics based on Spotify
1. Manual with easy langiage can be available for the software.
1. Client will be involved in the entire process of developing the system
